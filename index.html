          <p><a href="">Jen & Hyung</a> are a beloved duo known for their charismatic, silly, and loving dynamic. They are celebrated by those around them for bringing out the best in each other through their shared belief that the other is quite literally <a href="hyungil.html">the best person in the world</a>. After a few long years of <i>waiting for the right moment</i>, the couple finally started dating in the fall of 2024 and are now well on their way to a lifetime of shared laughter, curiosity, and abundant joy.</p>
          <p>The pair is made up of <a href="hyungil.html">Hyungil Shim</a>, <i>ENFP mommy tyrant</i>, and <a href="jennifer.html">Jennifer Lin</a>, <i>INFJ baby serf</i>. Though their roles may fluctuate with various situations and environments <i>(I mean, everyone wants to be the little spoon sometimes)</i>, the two have a beautiful mutually symbiotic relationship. Hyung is originally from California and Colorado. In his free time, he likes to read manga, browse eBay, and listen to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Tet">Four Tet</a>. Jen is originally from New York. In her free time, she likes to watch kdramas, try out dance classes, and find the perfect place to display her growing collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiski">Smiskis</a>.</p>
          <p>All good things take time, and their love story is no exception. From sneaky shared glances and nervous firsts, to the now subconscious pokes/prods (<i>sorry Hyung</i>) and whispered <i>I love you's</i>, Jen & Hyung's steadfast commitment to trust, care for, and love each other has become the heartbeat of their relationship and the backdrop that grounds their individual and shared lives.</p>

					<h2 id="TheEarlyDays">The Early Days</h2>
					<h3>Aug - Sept 2021: The initial spark</h3>
					<p>After graduating from their respective universities, Hyung and Jen were both starting their first post grad jobs in the summer of 2021. Among Hyung's consulting cohort was Jen's long time friend and college roommate, Anishta Khan. Through this shared connection, Hyung and Jen found themselves attending a comedy show together at Ratio Beerworks in Denver, Colorado <b>(August 4th, 2021)</b>. Though the actual standup routines have been long lost from Jen's memory, she remembers that day fondly as the first time she heard Hyung's characteristically bright and warm laugh.</p>

          <p>While some believe in <i>love at first sight</i>, others remain skeptical of how real an initial spark can really be. For Jen though, she could not help but feel so drawn to the sweet, stylish, and inquisitive Hyungil Shim <i>(first thought was damn he's cute, second thought was wow he's a great conversationalist)</i>. Thankfully, neither was shy about acting on their natural chemistry. What began as a causal dinner led to a spontaneous drive up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatirons">Flatirons</a>, which then became an evening in Hyung's hotel room - all attempts to prolong the night together <b>(August 14th, 2021)</b>. The two learned more about each other, Jen sharing videos she made for her family and Hyung sharing videos of his previous acting projects. That first date was marked by the achy pull of anticipation and craving, the slow gradual closing of the space between them, the first intertwining of their hands <i>(wow I still get goosebumps)</i>...all quintessential, irreplaceable moments of a budding relationship. In the first of many <i>Will they? Won't they?</i> moments, Jen decided to pull back out of fear of falling too quickly and deeply for someone who had to leave so soon.</p>
          <p>Don't worry though, that lasted about two weeks.</p>

          <p>After learning that Hyung will be staying an additional month in Colorado, Jen chose to surrender to her desires, willing to risk any eventual heartache for the beauty and exhiliration of exploring their undeniable connection. And so they enjoyed a month of just that - swing dancing under the stars, strolling through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Museum_of_Nature_and_Science">Muesum of Nature & Science</a>, testing each other in mini golf <i>(don't forget I won that)</i>, hikes, pool parties and more! But between the proper outings were the whimsical and mundane - serenely coworking at cafes <i>(Bittersweet, Trident - all subtle reminders of you)</i>, trying out new recipes (will always be <i>our</i> honey garlic chicken dish), and, perhaps most fundamentally to their relationship, simply lying with each other in all kinds of places doing what they do best - cuddle and yap. Bodies nestled close and comfortably, eyes agaze with eager curiosity - that was how they loved to be. The month past quickly as they dove deeper into the corners of their minds together - trading songs and books, exploring ideas and questions, and offering up their hearts with no hesitation. As was built the foundation of their love.</p>
          <p>When the time came, it was a bittersweet farewell, unequivocally understood by both, carrying the sentiment: <i>thank you for stopping by</i> (<a href="https://ohsarahkay.tumblr.com/whenlovearrives">Sarah Kay's poem</a> took on a new meaning after I met you).</p>

					<h3>Fall 2021 - Fall 2023: The years apart</h3>
					<p>During their years apart, the two grew seperately, settling into their cities and more importantly, into themselves. Ever so often, Jen and Hyung would cross paths, at a party when Jen comes back to NY or during Hyung's company retreat when he returned to Colorado. They would exchange a few words, share a lingering smile, yet mostly keeping their distance out of mutual respect.</p>
          <p>Two years past this way. </p>

						</div>
					</div>

          <p>Fast forward to March 2024, the two were at a friend’s DJ set when they learned they would both be in Chicago at the same time that month - Jen for a conference, Hyung for a law school acceptance day. And so they met up in the windy city and spent a sleepless night together, stumbling awkwardly back into each other’s lives, breaking the distance they had so carefully maintained <b>(March 24, 2024)</b>. <i>I still remember when we first laid together again, my body shaking from anxiety, uncertain what we were doing and what it all meant.</i> Neither Hyung nor Jen could see a clear path forward. With Hyung leaving for law school in the fall, a familiar question shadowed over them: were they willing to step back into something destined to end, <i>yet again?</i></p>
          <p>Hyung and Jen danced around this question for weeks - quite literally at the legendary KSHMR night <b>(March 30, 2024)</b> and figuratively through a series of meandering, back-and-forth conversations. During this time they still shared tender moments - buying groceries, cooking for each other, a trip to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Botanical_Garden">New York Botanic Garden</a>, a dinner with friends. In the end, time revealed that they were not ready - Hyung still navigating through the end of his past relationship, Jen not wanting to be caught in the middle. The days leading up to Hyung's leaving felt rash and reckless - both of them desperate to talk through how they felt, what they were to each other at that moment, and what they could someday become. Inevitably, they parted ways again - Hyung carrying with him Jen's copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_(book)"><i>The Prophet</i></a> and Jen holding onto Hyung's unmistakable purple sweatshirt.</p>

				  <h3>Summer 2024: The yearning and reunion</h3>
					<p>A summer of yearning and distractions, with the traces of each other lingering in the cracks and creases of their minds. Hyung spent the summer in Asia exploring and reflecting, documenting his weeks in his newsletter <i>(I checked and read these religiously)</i>. Jen spent her first NYC summer with friends, dating [redacted] and trying to move forward. But alas, they could not escape each other. On <b>August 25, 2024</b>, Hyung came by Jen's apartment to return their belongings. They shared openly with each other and from that moment on, they have not stopped talking.</p>
